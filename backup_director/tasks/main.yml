    # BUG: ERROR 1044 and 1064 messages on creation of Bacula MySQL tables
    # When we test this role using the Docker container approach defined in the
    # varilink/services-docker repository, at the point of creation of the
    # Bacula MySQL tables errors 1044 and 1064 are reported. However the
    # creation of the tables succeeds. Note that the creation of the Bacula
    # MySQL tables does not happen at the point of package installation in the
    # containers, whereas it does for a server install. Again, see the
    # varilink/services-docker repository and observe whether this same bug is
    # present for a server install or not.
