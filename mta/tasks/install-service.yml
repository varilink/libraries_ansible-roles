# This Mail Transport Agent role is imported by any other role that needs to
# send emails. It installs the exim4-daemon-light package.

# The mail_external and mail_internal roles need the greater capability provided
# by the exim4-daemon-heavy package and so they install that themselves. When
# they do, this replaces the exim4-daemon-light package that has already been
# installed by importing this role.

# On reruns, the mail_external and mail_internal roles again import this role,
# so this would revert the version of exim installed back to exim4-daemon-light,
# hence the check to see if exim4-daemon-heavy is installed below.

# TODO: Make this role configurable so that other roles that import it can
# specify whether they want the exim4-daemon-light or exim4-daemon-heavy package
# installed and not have to install any exim package themselves.
