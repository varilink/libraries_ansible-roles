# This role pulls in the mail role as a dependency. The mail role installs the
# dovecot-imapd and exim4-daemon-light pacakges but this role requires
# additional/different packages as follows:
#  - The dovecot-lmtpd package is required so that we can use the sieve mail
#    plugin to filter spam messages automatically.
#  - The dovecot-sieve package provides the Dovecot Sieve plugin to provide mail
#    filtering facilities at the time of final message delivery, which we use to
#    filter spam.
#  - The exim4-daemon-heavy package replaces the exim4 package for access to the
#    Dovecot authentication drivers.
